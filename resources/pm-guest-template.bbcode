Hi! Your guest difficulty on [url=https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/{{BEATMAPSET_ID}}]{{ARTIST}} - {{TITLE}}[/url] is going to be up for voting in {{MONTH}}'s round of [url=https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120]Project Loved[/url].

If you [i]do not[/i] want your guest difficulty to be put up for Loved voting, let me know and I can either leave that difficulty out of Loved or remove it from the mapset.

Thanks!
