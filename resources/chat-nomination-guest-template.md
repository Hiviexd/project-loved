Hi! Your guest or collab difficulty on [{{ARTIST}} - {{TITLE}}](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/{{BEATMAPSET_ID}}) is going to be up for voting in the {{ROUND_NAME}} round of Project Loved.

If you **do not** want your difficulty to be put up for Loved voting, let me know and I can either leave that difficulty out of Loved or remove it from the mapset.

Thanks!
